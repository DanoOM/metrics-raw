0.0.10
* Removed Legacy kairosDBListener, (replaced with indexed Implementation).
* Update Metric Registry/Listeners, (Users can now remove listeners, and stop listeners if they are threaded).
0.0.7
* Added KairosIndexedDBListener - handles data collisions within millisecond, by 'indexing' the event.
* Removed EventType - was never used
* Updated MetricRegistry Builder, renamed withHost, withDatacenter to withHostTag, withDatacenterTag
* Gauge threads changed to Daemon Threads.
* updated Test.java - to generate events for each metric type.
0.0.6
* Bug fix related to IndexedTimer.
0.0.5
* Added Experimental IndexedTimer - If 2 timers (same name/'primaryTag') are created within the same millisecond, one can have the metricRegistry 'index' the timer within the millisecond, by created a new tag (index) this will enable datastores with only millisecond precision to store the colliding data values. (should only be used if you expect high tps rates on the timer).
