0.0.5
 * Added Experimental IndexedTimer - If 2 timers (same name/'primaryTag') are created within the same millisecond, one can have the metricRegistry 'index' the timer within the millisecond, by created a new tag (index) this will enable datastores with only millisecond precision to store the colliding data values. (should only be used if you expect high tps rates on the timer).
0.0.6
 * Bug fix related to IndexedTimer.
